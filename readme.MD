# Fractal Trees
A fractal tree is known as a tree which can be created by recursively symmetrical branching.

The trunk of length 1 splits into two branches of length r, each making an angle q with the direction of the trunk. Both of these branches divides into two branches of length r*r, each making an angle q with the direction of its parent branch. Continuing in this way for infinitely many branching, the tree is the set of branches, together with their limit points, called branch tips.
